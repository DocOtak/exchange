Parameter,Format  ,Description notes
EXPOCODE,A14,"The expedition code, assigned by the CCHDO or generated by the user. A single alphanumeric word, without spaces, commas, or ""/"" characters (but ""_"" underscore characters are OK) which is unique cruise identifier code.  REQUIRED."
note,,"The convention the CCHDO uses to create the EXPOCODE is:

ExpoCode Syntax:    NODCShipCodeYearMonthDay

Example:

   Ship Name:          Roger Revelle

   Cruise start date:  March 29, 2009

   EXPOCODE:           33RR20090329"
SECT,A6,"If a repeat of a WOCE section, this is the WHP section identifier. Optional."
STNNBR,A6,"The originator's station number. This column is used for a single alphanumeric word, without spaces, commas, or ""/"" characters (but ""_"" underscore characters are OK) which is unique station identifier. Numeric-only STATION identifiers are preferred by many data users, but provision for alphanumeric identifiers is retained to maintain compatibility with WOCE records. REQUIRED."
CASTNO,I3,The originator's cast number. This column is used for a single integer cast number. Where cast number is unknown a default value of 1 is used or written in by the CCHDO. REQUIRED.
note,,"No ""cast type"" designator is used."
SAMPNO,A7,"The sample number as described in this report, Section 5. It is very strongly recommended that at least one, preferably both, of the parameters SAMPNO and BTLNBR be reported for bottle data files. Where neither SAMPNO or BTLNBR are available, the CCHDO will add a SAMPNO column containing consecutive integers for each station/cast."
BTLNBR,A7,"The bottle identification number as described in this report, Section 5. It is very strongly suggested that at least one, preferably both, of the parameters SAMPNO and BTLNBR be reported for bottle data files. It is preferred that one of these, preferably BTLNBR, include a quality flag in the column immediately to its right. This is the primary index to a water sample. [Pressure - or depth - is a measured parameter. The pressure value can change during processing, and so pressure (or sample depth) should never be used to index water sample data.]"
BTLNBR_FLAG_W,I1,"The parameter name of a data quality flag should be identical to the actual parameter name, followed by ""FLAG"" and then by a character indicating the type of quality flag, with underscores between each word. W = WHP quality flag; I = IGOSS quality flag; U = quality flag from user-defined table."
DATE,I8,Cast date in YYYYMMDD integer format. REQUIRED
TIME,I4,"Cast time (UT) as HHMM. Optional. Must have all four digits.

The CCHDO prefers only one TIME value per cast, usually the time the rosette was at its deepest depth (i.e. when the first bottle is closed).  Users who wish to record the time each bottle closes are urged to add a second time-related column, BTL_TIME, where the closure time for each bottle can be recorded."
LATITUDE,F8.4,"Latitude as SDD.dddd where ""S"" is sign (blank or missing is positive), DD are degrees, and dddd are decimal degrees. Sign is positive in northern hemisphere, negative in southern hemisphere. Spaces to left of leftmost digit are ignored. Data with positions not reliable to ten-thousandths of a degree should be padded with meaningless zeros. The ""BO"" or ""bottom"" position (ship position when cast is at deepest level) should be used if available, with ""BE"" (ship position at cast start) or ""EN"" (ship position at cast end) used in that priority order when ""BO"" position is not available. REQUIRED

The CCHDO prefers only one LATITUDE per cast, usually the ship's position when the rosette was at its deepest depth (i.e. when the first bottle is closed).  Users who wish to record the position each bottle closes are urged to add a second latitude-related column, BTL_LAT, where the position at time of closure for each bottle can be recorded."
LONGITUDE   ,F9.4,"Longitude as SDDD.dddd where ""S"" is sign (blank or missing is positive), DDD are degrees, and dddd are decimal degrees. Sign is positive for ""east"" longitude, negative for ""west"" longitude. Spaces to left of leftmost digit are ignored. Data with positions not reliable to ten-thousandths of a degree should be padded with meaningless zeros. The ""BO"" or ""bottom"" position (ship position when cast is at deepest level) should be used if available, with ""BE"" (ship position at cast start) or ""EN"" (ship position at cast end) used in that priority order when ""BO"" position is not available. REQUIRED

The CCHDO prefers only one LONGITUDE per cast, usually the ship's position when the rosette was at its deepest depth (i.e. when the first bottle is closed).  Users who wish to record the position each bottle closes are urged to add a second longitude-related column, BTL_LONG, where the position at time of closure for each bottle can be recorded."
DEPTH,I5,"Reported depth to bottom. Preferred units are ""meters"" and should be specified in Line 2. In general, corrected depths are preferred to uncorrected depths. Documentation accompanying data should include notes on methodology of correction.  When no depth-to-bottom is supplied by the data originator for one or more rows of data in a _hy1.csv file which contains a ""DEPTH"" column, -999 may be written in by the CCHDO.  Optional but strongly preferred."
