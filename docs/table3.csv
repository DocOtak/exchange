CTDPRS,F9.1,decibars,corrected CTD pressure (in a _hy1.csv file the value accompanying closure of the rosette bottle); normally no data quality flag is needed when reported in the bottle file; sometimes reported as CTDP or PRES; data from each cast should be sorted from lowest pressure to highest pressure
CTDTMP,F9.4,"degrees C 
(specify ITS-90 
or IPTS-68 if  
known)",corrected CTD temperature (in a _hy1.csv file the value accompanying closure of the rosette bottle); no data quality flag is needed when reported in the bottle file; sometimes reported as CTDT or TEMP
CTDSAL,F9.4,,corrected CTD salinity (in a _hy1.csv file the value accompanying closure of the rosette bottle); sometimes reported as CTDS

quality flag;","The parameter name of a data flag should be identical to the actual parameter name, followed by ""FLAG"" and then by a character indicating the type of quality flag, with underscores between each word."

supplied in 
comment lines)","[A FLAG value can follow any data value, and should follow almost every data value. FLAG is shown here only for CTDSAL for simplicity. Typically a data file will have FLAG_W values following most parameters in this table except for CTDPRS and CTDTMP.]"
SALNTY,F9.4,,bottle salinity; sometimes reported as SALT
CTDOXY,F9.1,µmol/kg,corrected CTD oxygen (in a _hy1.csv file the value accompanying closure of the rosette bottle; may not be available in some _hy1.csv files); sometimes reported as CTDO or CTDO2
OXYGEN,F9.1,µmol/kg,"bottle oxygen (must specify actual units, not simply copy the suggested units); sometimes reported as O2 or OXY"
SILCAT,F9.2,µmol/kg,"silicate (values in µmol/kg units are only 3% different than values in µmol/l units; so one must specify actual units reported, not simply copy the suggested units); sometimes reported as SIO3"
NITRAT,F9.2,µmol/kg,"nitrate (values in µmol/kg units are only 3% different than values in µmol/l units; so one must specify actual units reported, not simply copy the suggested units); sometimes reported as NO3"
"NO2+NO3
(shown only  if separate   NITRAT and   NITRIT are   not available)",F9.2,µmol/kg,"nitrate plus nitrite (values in µmol/kg units are only 3% different than values in µmol/l units; so one must specify actual units reported, not simply copy the suggested units)
[Techniques for determining dissolved nitrate may return a value of nitrate (NO3) plus nitrite (NO2). A separate determination is then done for nitrite and the result subtracted by the data originator to obtain nitrate. If no separate nitrite determination was carried out - or in rare cases the nitrite number was not subtracted - data providers should list the result as NO2+NO3. Because nitrite values are in most regions small compared to nitrate, most data users will not adversely affect their results by relabeling NO2+NO3 as NITRAT.]"
NITRIT,F9.2,µmol/kg,"nitrite (see NO2+NO3) (values in µmol/kg units are only 3% different than values in µmol/l units; so one must specify actual units reported, not simply copy the suggested units); sometimes reported as NO2"
