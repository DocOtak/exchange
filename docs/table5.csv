quality flag.","The parameter name of a data flag should be identical to the actual parameter name, followed by ""FLAG"" and then by a character indicating the type of quality flag, with underscores between each word."
,,"[U = quality  
flag from user- 
defined table]",[A FLAG value can follow any data value in this table. FLAG is shown here only for CTDPRS for simplicity. Typically a WHP data file will have FLAG_W values following every parameter in this table.]

or IPTS-68 if  
known)",corrected CTD temperature
CTDSAL,F9.4,,corrected CTD salinity
CTDOXY,F9.1,µmol/kg,"corrected CTD oxygen (must specify actual units, not simply copy the suggested units)"
,,,"Other parameters embedded in the CTD data stream, and their associated quality bytes, may be included in the _ct1.csv data file following the general protocols listed here."
